# UFOs Analysis
## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the effectiveness of a UFO sighting information webpage that contains a table that can be filtered. The funcionality and filterability of the table is what will be focused on.
## Results
This webpage works by the user simply entering the criteria they want to filter into one of the 5 provided categories which consist of: date, city, state, country, and shape. Once the desired criteria is entered the table will automatically update to provide the freshly filtered data. However for the table to properly function the user must unter the data in the same format as shown in the example provided. For example if the user wanted to search for UFO sightings in Arizona they would type "ar" into the filter box for state and all of the sightings from Arizona will appear. However if the user typed in "Arizona" or "AR" no results would appear.
## Summary
 - The largest drawback of this webpage is that the data must appear in the same format
 - One recomendation for the future would be the ability to have slightly different formats be entered and the proper results still displayed.
 - Another recomendation would be to add a filter for the duration of the event as well.
